## v0.6.0

This release makes a backwards incompatible API change that affects
how fwup public keys are shared with other projects. This should
only affect the `nerves_hub` library and should be handled by mix dependency
constraints.

* Backwards incompatible changes
  * The API to share fwup public keys has changed. This should only affect the
    `nerves_hub` library and should be handled by mix dependency constraints.
  * `mix nerves_hub.ca_certificate create` is now `register`. (It never created
    a certificate.

    you're running against api.nerves-hub.org vs. your own instance
