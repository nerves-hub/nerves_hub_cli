## v3.0.0

The NervesHubCLI has been updated to use [Burrito](https://github.com/burrito-elixir/burrito)
for building native binaries.

This includes support for MacOS (x86_64 and aarch64), Linux (x86_64 and aarch64), and Windows (x86_64).

This new packaging of the NervesHubCLI simplifies the installation process, and provides a more
consistent experience across platforms and projects.

## v2.1.0

This updates NervesHubCLI to be installable as an escript which can be
installed with `mix escript.install hex nerves_hub_cli`. See the README
for more information on installation and usage.

Mix tasks are still available for use, but will soon be deprecated. To
support escript, `mix nerves_hub.firmware` removed the ability to infer
a firmware location for `sign` and `publish` commands. Instead, firmware
path must be included as an argument:

```sh
mix nerves_hub.firmware publish /path/to/firmware
mix nerves_hub.firmware sign /path/to/firmware
```

## v2.0.1

* Updated
  * You can now use a single URI for defining the NervesHub instance you are connecting.
  * `CAStore` is now an optional dep. If you have included `CAStore` in your Nerves project it will be used, otherwise `:public_key` will be the fallback.
  * Firmware uploads will default to using HTTP1 as HTTP2 streaming issues exist with the `Tesla` usage of `Mint`

## v2.0.0

Update for compatibility with NervesHub 2.0

* Removed
  * Remove signing devices (and users) by NervesHub. It is now expected that users
    manage their own device signer certificates. Device certificates can still be
    created locally with `mix nerves_hub.device cert create --signer-cert /path/signer-cert.pem --signer-key /path/signer-key.pem`
  * Remove resolving public keys for fwup. This must now be explicitly set

* Updated
  * Swap to the Mint adapter instead of `:hackney`

* Added
  * `:nerves_hub_user_api` has now been merged into this lib

## v0.12.0

* Enhancements
  * Support token authentication with NervesHub - This should be backwards compatible
    but does emit a warning when the user peer client cert is used for authentication.
    Use `mix nerves_hub.user auth` to generate a token if your NervesHub instance
    supports it, or create in the user settings of the web.

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixes a variable mismatch (thanks @pojiro)

## v0.11.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixes issue using a `:ca_store` module from the root project by forcing
    a full compile of the project, which implicitly loads the needed module.

## v0.11.0

* Breaking Changes
  * This release includes a change to how CA certificates are used in the connection
    to NervesHub. If you are connecting to the publicly hosted https://nerves-hub.org,
    then no changes are required.
    If you are manually supplying `:ca_certs` config value to connect to another instance
    of NervesHub, then you will need to update you config following the new instructions
    for [Configuration](https://github.com/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_user_api#configuration)
    in the NervesHubUserAPI README.

## v0.10.5

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixes issue rendering devices when the device does not have any tags

* Enhancements
  * Certificate serials are now also displayed as a hex value to match OpenSSL output
  * Add cert description to ca_certificate list
  * More specific location output when creating user auth cert

## v0.10.4

* Enhancements
  * Added `mix nerves_hub.device cert import DEVICE_ID CERT_PATH` for adding
    trusted device certificates.
  * Changed Deployment `is_active` true/false to `state` on/off to match wording
    on the server.

## v0.10.3

* Bug fixes
  * Fix deprecation warnings for `nerves_hub_user_api` calls

## v0.10.2

* Enhancements
  * More results printout in the `nerves_hub.device bulk_create` task which reports
    errors, malformed lines, and successful creates.

## v0.10.1

* Bug fixes
  * Ignore whitepace in base64-encoded string input

## v0.10.0

* Breaking changes
  * Decouples deprecated `:nerves_hub` config values and will fail compilation if used.
  To set your organization for the CLI, use `:nerves_hub_cli` key:
  ```elixir
  config :nerves_hub_cli, org: "my-org"
  ```

* Enhancements
  * `mix nerves_hub.device bulk_create --csv path/to/file.csv` - Support bulk upload
  from CSV definitions
  * Add ability to use your own signer CA and key locally when creating device certificate
  `mix nerves_hub.device cert create --signer-cert path/to/cert --signer-key path/to/key`

## v0.9.1

* Enhancements
  * Updated user auth to support logging in with username or email.
  * Improved error message formatting.

## v0.9.0

Backwards incompatible changes:

The NervesHubUserAPI.Device and NervesHubUserAPI.DeviceCertificate endpoints
have moved to include `product` as part of its path.

## v0.6.0

This release makes a backwards incompatible API change that affects
how fwup public keys are shared with other projects. This should
only affect the `nerves_hub` library and should be handled by mix dependency
constraints.

* Backwards incompatible changes
  * The API to share fwup public keys has changed. This should only affect the
    `nerves_hub` library and should be handled by mix dependency constraints.
  * `mix nerves_hub.ca_certificate create` is now `register`. (It never created
    a certificate.

* Enhancements
  * Show API endpoint when running commands - this makes it more obvious when
    you're running against api.nerves-hub.org vs. your own instance

## v0.5.1

    openssl.
  * Updated Docs and CLI prompts.
